    <h1>THOUGHTS 101: RANDOM THINKING</h1>
    <p>  Do you ever think we deserve  to be loved , do you think we should ever pursue happiness, do you think  pursuing happines is the right thing to do.do you think religion is real , i was born into a religious family and was raised practically in the church but yet the logic part of me wont rest, it wont keep asking are these all real. if u ask me do miracles exist i would say yes but at the same 
        time i stil question how . why dont God come to speak with us ,are our sins too strong for
         his sight ,at the same time they say the devil can disguise himself so hiw do we know its Gods calling oh this thought was nonsense im sure the devil will tell you to do something evil and GOD something good </p>
    <h1>THOUGHTS 102:STUPID THINKING</h1>   
    <p>Why is the earth round , why are some people short and some tall if we are all created in your image and also about beauty ,why are some beautiful and others are not since we are all created in your image, does that mean you are both beautiful and ugly? </p>
